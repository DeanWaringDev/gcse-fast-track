# Screen 1: What is a Ratio?

A **ratio** compares the sizes of two or more quantities. Ratios are everywhere in real life!

**You use ratios when:**
- 🥤 Making squash: "Mix 1 part squash to 4 parts water"
- 🎨 Mixing paint: "2 parts blue to 1 part yellow makes green"
- 📊 Comparing things: "There are 12 boys to 15 girls in the class"
- 🍰 Following recipes: "250g flour to 100g butter"
- 💷 Sharing money: "Split £60 in the ratio 2:3"

## How to Write Ratios

Ratios use the **colon symbol (:)** to separate the numbers.

**Example 1: Boys to Girls**
```
12 boys to 15 girls
Written as: 12:15
Say: "twelve to fifteen"
```

**Example 2: Squash to Water**
```
1 part squash to 4 parts water
Written as: 1:4
Say: "one to four"
```

**Example 3: Three Parts**
Ratios can have more than two parts!
```
Mix red:blue:yellow in ratio 3:2:1
Say: "three to two to one"
```

## Important Points

**Order Matters!**
- 2:3 is NOT the same as 3:2
- Always keep the same order as the question

**No Units in Ratios**
- Write 12:15 (not 12 boys:15 girls)
- The units must be the same
- If mixing 2kg flour with 500g butter, convert to same units first!

## Real-Life Example

**Recipe for pancakes:**
- 200g flour
- 100g sugar
- The ratio of flour to sugar is **200:100** or simplified to **2:1**

This means: For every 2 parts flour, you need 1 part sugar.

# Screen 2: Why Simplify Ratios?

Just like fractions, we **simplify ratios** to make them easier to understand and use.

## What Does "Simplify" Mean?

**Simplifying a ratio** means writing it in its **smallest whole numbers** while keeping the same proportions.

**Example:**
```
12:15 simplified is 4:5

Both mean the same thing:
• 12 parts to 15 parts
• 4 parts to 5 parts

The second one is just easier to work with!
```

## Why Bother Simplifying?

**Reason 1: Easier to Understand**
```
Which is clearer?
18:27 or 2:3?

Both are correct, but 2:3 is much simpler!
```

**Reason 2: Easier to Scale Up**
```
If you need to double a recipe with ratio 2:3:
• 2×2 = 4, 3×2 = 6, so new ratio is 4:6

Much easier than 18×2 and 27×2!
```

**Reason 3: Exam Marks!**
```
In GCSE exams, you often need to give ratios
in their simplest form to get full marks! ✓
```

## The Golden Rule

**A ratio is in its simplest form when:**
- All numbers are **whole numbers** (no fractions or decimals)
- There is **no common factor** (except 1) that divides into all parts

**Examples:**
- ✓ **2:3** is simplified (only 1 divides into both)
- ✗ **4:6** is not simplified (2 divides into both)
- ✓ **5:7:9** is simplified (only 1 divides into all three)
- ✗ **10:14:18** is not simplified (2 divides into all three)

# Screen 3: Finding Common Factors

To simplify ratios, we need to find **common factors** - numbers that divide into all parts of the ratio.

## What is a Common Factor?

A **common factor** is a number that divides exactly into two or more numbers.

**Example: Find common factors of 12 and 18**

**Factors of 12:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12  
**Factors of 18:** 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18

**Common factors:** 1, 2, 3, 6

The **highest common factor (HCF)** is **6** - this is what we use to simplify!

## Quick Methods to Find Common Factors

**Method 1: Listing Factors**
```
For 12:18

Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18

Common: 1, 2, 3, 6
Highest: 6
```

**Method 2: Division Check**
```
Can both numbers be divided by:
2? ✓ 12÷2=6, 18÷2=9
3? ✓ 12÷3=4, 18÷3=6
4? ✗ 18÷4 doesn't work
5? ✗ Neither divides by 5
6? ✓ 12÷6=2, 18÷6=3

Highest is 6
```

**Method 3: Times Tables Trick**
```
If one number is in the other's times table:
12:18

18 is in the 6 times table (6×3=18)
12 is in the 6 times table (6×2=12)

So 6 is a common factor!
```

## Easy Common Factors to Spot

**All even numbers** → divide by 2
- 4:6, 10:14, 20:30

**Both end in 5 or 0** → divide by 5
- 15:20, 25:35, 10:15

**Add the digits and it's divisible by 3** → divide by 3
- 12:18 (1+2=3✓, 1+8=9✓)
- 15:21 (1+5=6✓, 2+1=3✓)

# Screen 4: Simplifying Ratios - The Method

Here's the step-by-step method for simplifying any ratio:

## The 3-Step Method

**Step 1:** Find a common factor of all the numbers  
**Step 2:** Divide all parts by that common factor  
**Step 3:** Check if you can simplify further

## Example 1: Simple Ratio

**Simplify 12:18**

**Step 1:** Find common factor
```
Both are even, so divide by 2
```

**Step 2:** Divide both parts
```
12 ÷ 2 = 6
18 ÷ 2 = 9

New ratio: 6:9
```

**Step 3:** Can we simplify further?
```
Both still have common factor 3!
6 ÷ 3 = 2
9 ÷ 3 = 3

Final answer: 2:3 ✓
```

**Quick method:** Use the HCF (6) straight away!
```
12 ÷ 6 = 2
18 ÷ 6 = 3

Answer: 2:3 ✓
```

## Example 2: Larger Numbers

**Simplify 20:30**

**Step 1:** Common factor = 10 (both end in 0)

**Step 2:** Divide
```
20 ÷ 10 = 2
30 ÷ 10 = 3
```

**Step 3:** 2 and 3 have no common factors

**Answer: 2:3** ✓

## Example 3: Three Parts

**Simplify 6:9:12**

**Step 1:** Common factor = 3

**Step 2:** Divide all three parts
```
6 ÷ 3 = 2
9 ÷ 3 = 3
12 ÷ 3 = 4
```

**Step 3:** No further common factors

**Answer: 2:3:4** ✓

## Example 4: Already Simplified

**Simplify 3:7**

**Step 1:** Find common factor
```
Only 1 divides into both
```

**Answer: 3:7** (already in simplest form!) ✓

# Screen 5: Common Mistakes to Avoid

Let's look at the mistakes students often make - and how to avoid them!

## Mistake 1: Only Dividing One Part

**WRONG ❌**
```
Simplify 8:12

8 ÷ 4 = 2
12 stays as 12

Answer: 2:12  WRONG!
```

**RIGHT ✓**
```
Simplify 8:12

8 ÷ 4 = 2
12 ÷ 4 = 3

Answer: 2:3  CORRECT!
```

**Remember:** Divide ALL parts by the same number!

## Mistake 2: Not Simplifying Completely

**WRONG ❌**
```
Simplify 20:30

20 ÷ 2 = 10
30 ÷ 2 = 15

Answer: 10:15  Not fully simplified!
```

**RIGHT ✓**
```
Simplify 20:30

20 ÷ 10 = 2
30 ÷ 10 = 3

Answer: 2:3  Fully simplified!

OR divide by 2, then by 5:
20→10→2
30→15→3
```

**Remember:** Keep going until you can't divide any more!

## Mistake 3: Changing the Order

**WRONG ❌**
```
Question: Ratio of boys to girls is 12:15

Answer: 5:4  WRONG ORDER!
```

**RIGHT ✓**
```
Question: Ratio of boys to girls is 12:15

12 ÷ 3 = 4
15 ÷ 3 = 5

Answer: 4:5  (boys:girls in correct order)
```

**Remember:** Keep the same order as the question!

## Mistake 4: Using Different Units

**WRONG ❌**
```
Ratio of 2kg to 500g

Answer: 2:500  WRONG!
```

**RIGHT ✓**
```
Convert to same units first:
2kg = 2000g

Ratio: 2000:500
2000 ÷ 500 = 4
500 ÷ 500 = 1

Answer: 4:1  CORRECT!
```

**Remember:** Always use the same units!

# Screen 6: Real-World Applications

Let's see how simplifying ratios works in real situations!

## Cooking & Recipes

**Example 1: Mixing Squash**
```
Instruction: Mix 200ml squash with 800ml water

Ratio: 200:800

Simplify:
Both divide by 200
200 ÷ 200 = 1
800 ÷ 200 = 4

Simplified ratio: 1:4

This means: For every 1 part squash, add 4 parts water
```

**Example 2: Cake Recipe**
```
250g flour, 150g sugar, 100g butter

Ratio: 250:150:100

Divide all by 50:
250 ÷ 50 = 5
150 ÷ 50 = 3
100 ÷ 50 = 2

Simplified: 5:3:2
```

## Art & Design

**Example 3: Mixing Paint**
```
Mix 300ml blue paint with 450ml white paint

Ratio: 300:450

Divide by 150:
300 ÷ 150 = 2
450 ÷ 150 = 3

Simplified: 2:3

To make more: Use 2 parts blue to 3 parts white!
```

## School & Class

**Example 4: Class Ratio**
```
Class has 18 boys and 12 girls

Ratio boys:girls = 18:12

Divide by 6:
18 ÷ 6 = 3
12 ÷ 6 = 2

Simplified: 3:2

For every 3 boys, there are 2 girls
```

## Money & Sharing

**Example 5: Sharing Pocket Money**
```
Mum gives £10 to Tom and £15 to Sarah

Ratio: 10:15

Divide by 5:
10 ÷ 5 = 2
15 ÷ 5 = 3

Simplified: 2:3

Tom gets 2 parts, Sarah gets 3 parts
```
