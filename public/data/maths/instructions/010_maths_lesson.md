# Screen 1: What Are Like Terms?

Now you understand algebra basics, let's learn how to **simplify expressions** by collecting like terms!

## What Does "Simplify" Mean?

**Simplifying** means writing an expression in its shortest, neatest form - combining everything you can.

**Example:**
```
Long version: x + x + x + 2 + 3
Simplified: 3x + 5

Both mean the same thing, but 3x + 5 is much cleaner!
```

## What Are "Like Terms"?

**Like terms** are terms that have exactly the same variable part.

**These are like terms:**
- 3x and 5x (both have x)
- 2y and -7y (both have y)
- 4a² and a² (both have a²)

**These are NOT like terms:**
- 3x and 5y (different letters)
- 2x and 3x² (different powers)
- 5 and 5x (one has x, one doesn't)

## The Golden Rule

**You can only add or subtract like terms!**

Think of it like this:
- ✓ 3 apples + 2 apples = 5 apples
- ✗ 3 apples + 2 oranges = ? (can't combine!)

Same with algebra:
- ✓ 3x + 2x = 5x
- ✗ 3x + 2y = ? (can't combine - leave as 3x + 2y)

## Why Simplify?

**Makes expressions:**
- Easier to read
- Easier to work with
- Easier to substitute values into
- Neater for exams!

**Example:**
```
Which is clearer?
x + x + x + 2 + 3 + x
or
4x + 5

The second one! Much simpler.

# Screen 2: Collecting Like Terms - The Basics

Let's learn the method for collecting like terms step by step!

## The Method

**Step 1:** Identify which terms are like terms  
**Step 2:** Add or subtract the coefficients  
**Step 3:** Write the simplified expression

## Example 1: Simple Addition

**Simplify: 3x + 5x**

**Step 1:** Both terms have x - they're like terms!

**Step 2:** Add coefficients
```
3x + 5x
= (3 + 5)x
= 8x
```

**Answer: 8x** ✓

## Example 2: With Subtraction

**Simplify: 7a - 2a**

**Step 1:** Both have a - like terms!

**Step 2:** Subtract coefficients
```
7a - 2a
= (7 - 2)a
= 5a
```

**Answer: 5a** ✓

## Example 3: Three Terms

**Simplify: 2y + 4y + 3y**

**Step 1:** All have y - all like terms!

**Step 2:** Add coefficients
```
2y + 4y + 3y
= (2 + 4 + 3)y
= 9y
```

**Answer: 9y** ✓

## Example 4: Addition and Subtraction

**Simplify: 5x + 3x - 2x**

**Step 1:** All have x - like terms!

**Step 2:** Work left to right
```
5x + 3x - 2x
= 8x - 2x
= 6x
```

**Answer: 6x** ✓

## Think of It This Way

**3x means:** x + x + x  
**5x means:** x + x + x + x + x  
**3x + 5x means:** x + x + x + x + x + x + x + x = 8x

# Screen 3: Collecting Different Terms

Most expressions have multiple different types of terms. Let's learn to handle them!

## Example 1: Two Different Variables

**Simplify: 4x + 3y + 2x**

**Step 1:** Identify like terms
- 4x and 2x are like terms (both have x)
- 3y is on its own

**Step 2:** Collect the x terms
```
4x + 2x = 6x
```

**Step 3:** Write complete answer
```
6x + 3y
```

**Answer: 6x + 3y** ✓

## Example 2: More Complex

**Simplify: 5a + 2b + 3a - b**

**Step 1:** Group like terms
- a terms: 5a and 3a
- b terms: 2b and -b

**Step 2:** Collect each type
```
5a + 3a = 8a
2b - b = 1b = b
```

**Step 3:** Write answer
```
8a + b
```

**Answer: 8a + b** ✓

## Example 3: With Constants

**Simplify: 3x + 5 + 2x + 4**

**Step 1:** Group like terms
- x terms: 3x and 2x
- Number terms: 5 and 4

**Step 2:** Collect each type
```
3x + 2x = 5x
5 + 4 = 9
```

**Step 3:** Write answer
```
5x + 9
```

**Answer: 5x + 9** ✓

## Example 4: All Three Types

**Simplify: 4x + 3y + 2 + x - y + 5**

**Step 1:** Group like terms
- x terms: 4x and x
- y terms: 3y and -y
- Numbers: 2 and 5

**Step 2:** Collect each
```
4x + x = 5x
3y - y = 2y
2 + 5 = 7
```

**Answer: 5x + 2y + 7** ✓

# Screen 4: Watch Out for Negatives!

Negative terms can be tricky - let's make sure you get them right!

## The Minus Sign Belongs to the Term

**Important:** The - sign stays with the term that follows it!

**Example: 5x - 3x**
```
Think of it as: 5x + (-3x)
5 + (-3) = 2
Answer: 2x
```

## Example 1: Subtracting Larger from Smaller

**Simplify: 3x - 7x**

```
3x - 7x
= (3 - 7)x
= -4x
```

**Answer: -4x** ✓

## Example 2: Multiple Negatives

**Simplify: 8a - 3a - 2a**

```
8a - 3a - 2a
= (8 - 3 - 2)a
= 3a
```

**Answer: 3a** ✓

## Example 3: Mixed Signs

**Simplify: 5x - 2x + 4x - 3x**

```
5x - 2x + 4x - 3x
= (5 - 2 + 4 - 3)x
= 4x
```

**Answer: 4x** ✓

## Example 4: Different Terms with Negatives

**Simplify: 6x - 2y - 3x + 5y**

**Step 1:** Group like terms
- x terms: 6x and -3x
- y terms: -2y and 5y

**Step 2:** Collect
```
6x - 3x = 3x
-2y + 5y = 3y
```

**Answer: 3x + 3y** ✓

## Top Tip!

If you're confused by signs, rewrite using brackets:
```
5x - 3x becomes 5x + (-3x)
Then just add: 5 + (-3) = 2
So: 2x
```

# Screen 5: When the Coefficient is 1

Remember: when there's no number in front of a variable, the coefficient is 1!

## Example 1: Adding x

**Simplify: 4x + x**

```
Remember: x means 1x

4x + x
= 4x + 1x
= (4 + 1)x
= 5x
```

**Answer: 5x** ✓

## Example 2: Subtracting x

**Simplify: 7y - y**

```
7y - y
= 7y - 1y
= (7 - 1)y
= 6y
```

**Answer: 6y** ✓

## Example 3: Just x Terms

**Simplify: x + x + x**

```
= 1x + 1x + 1x
= (1 + 1 + 1)x
= 3x
```

**Answer: 3x** ✓

## Example 4: Mixed

**Simplify: 3a + a - 2a + a**

```
= 3a + 1a - 2a + 1a
= (3 + 1 - 2 + 1)a
= 3a
```

**Answer: 3a** ✓

## Example 5: With Other Terms

**Simplify: 5x + y + 2x - y + 3**

```
x terms: 5x + 2x = 7x
y terms: y - y = 0 (they cancel!)
Numbers: 3

Answer: 7x + 3
```

**Answer: 7x + 3** ✓

**Notice:** When terms completely cancel out, they disappear from the answer!

# Screen 6: Harder Examples - Putting It All Together

Now let's try some more challenging simplifications!

## Example 1: Five Terms

**Simplify: 7x + 3 - 2x + 5 - 3x**

**Step 1:** Group like terms
```
x terms: 7x, -2x, -3x
Numbers: 3, 5
```

**Step 2:** Collect
```
7x - 2x - 3x = 2x
3 + 5 = 8
```

**Answer: 2x + 8** ✓

## Example 2: Three Variables

**Simplify: 4x + 2y - 3z + x - y + 2z**

**Step 1:** Group
```
x terms: 4x + x = 5x
y terms: 2y - y = y
z terms: -3z + 2z = -z
```

**Answer: 5x + y - z** ✓

## Example 3: Lots of Terms!

**Simplify: 3a + 5b + 2 + 4a - 3b + 7 - a + b**

**Step 1:** Group carefully
```
a terms: 3a + 4a - a = 6a
b terms: 5b - 3b + b = 3b
Numbers: 2 + 7 = 9
```

**Answer: 6a + 3b + 9** ✓

## Example 4: All Negatives

**Simplify: -2x - 3y + 5x - 4y**

```
x terms: -2x + 5x = 3x
y terms: -3y - 4y = -7y
```

**Answer: 3x - 7y** ✓

## Example 5: Terms That Cancel

**Simplify: 5x + 3y - 5x + 2y**

```
x terms: 5x - 5x = 0 (cancel out!)
y terms: 3y + 2y = 5y
```

**Answer: 5y** ✓
