# Screen 1: What Are Decimals?

**Decimals** are another way of writing numbers, especially when we need to show parts that are **smaller than 1**.

You see decimals everywhere in real life:
- **Money:** £4.99, £12.50
- **Measurements:** 1.75 metres tall, 0.5 kg of sugar
- **Scores:** 9.5 out of 10, 87.3%
- **Petrol prices:** £1.47 per litre

## Understanding the Decimal Point

The decimal point (.) separates the **whole number** part from the **fraction** part.

```
12.34
│  │
│  └─ This is the fraction part (34 hundredths)
└──── This is the whole number part (12)
```

## Place Value with Decimals

Just like whole numbers have place values (units, tens, hundreds), decimals also have place values:

```
  1    2   .   3    4
  ↓    ↓   .   ↓    ↓
Tens Units . Tenths Hundredths
```

**Breaking down 12.34:**
- 1 ten = 10
- 2 units = 2
- 3 tenths = 0.3 (which is 3/10)
- 4 hundredths = 0.04 (which is 4/100)

**Total:** 10 + 2 + 0.3 + 0.04 = **12.34**

## Key Point

The further right you go from the decimal point, the **smaller** the value:
- Tenths (0.1) are bigger than hundredths (0.01)
- Hundredths (0.01) are bigger than thousandths (0.001)

Think of it like this:
- 0.5 = 5 tenths = half
- 0.05 = 5 hundredths = much smaller!

# Screen 2: Reading and Writing Decimals

Being able to **read** and **write** decimals correctly is essential!

## How to Read Decimals

**Example: 3.7**
Say: "Three **point** seven" (not "three point seventy")

**Example: 12.45**
Say: "Twelve **point** four five" (not "twelve point forty-five")

**Example: 0.8**
Say: "Zero point eight" or "Nought point eight"

## Writing Decimals in Words

**0.3** = three tenths
**0.07** = seven hundredths  
**0.25** = twenty-five hundredths
**2.5** = two and five tenths

## Comparing Decimals

Which is bigger: **0.7** or **0.67**?

**Method:** Line up the decimal points and compare digit by digit from left to right.

```
0.7  → 0.70 (adding a zero doesn't change the value)
0.67 → 0.67

Compare tenths: 7 vs 6
7 is bigger than 6
```

**Answer: 0.7 is bigger than 0.67** ✓

## Top Tip!

Adding zeros after the last digit after a decimal point **doesn't change the value**:
- 0.5 = 0.50 = 0.500 = 0.5000

This is really useful when adding and subtracting decimals!

## Practice These

**Order from smallest to biggest:**
```
0.4, 0.04, 0.44, 0.444

Answer:
0.04, 0.4, 0.44, 0.444
```

The more digits after the decimal, the more precise the number!

# Screen 3: Adding Decimals

Adding decimals is just like adding whole numbers - **as long as you line up the decimal points!**

## The Golden Rule

**Always line up the decimal points vertically** - this makes sure you're adding:
- Tenths to tenths
- Hundredths to hundredths
- Units to units

## Example 1: Simple Addition

**Calculate: 3.4 + 2.5**

**Step 1:** Write the numbers with decimal points lined up
```
  3.4
+ 2.5
-----
```

**Step 2:** Add each column starting from the right (just like whole numbers)
```
  3.4
+ 2.5
-----
  5.9
```

**Answer: 5.9** ✓

## Example 2: Different Decimal Places

**Calculate: 4.7 + 2.35**

**Step 1:** Line up decimal points (add a zero if it helps you see it clearly)
```
  4.70
+ 2.35
------
```

**Step 2:** Add each column
```
  4.70
+ 2.35
------
  7.05
```

**Answer: 7.05** ✓

## Example 3: With Carrying

**Calculate: 5.8 + 3.6**

```
  ¹   (carrying)
  5.8
+ 3.6
-----
  9.4
```

**Step-by-step:**
- 8 + 6 = 14 (write 4, carry 1)
- 5 + 3 + 1 = 9

**Answer: 9.4** ✓

## Example 4: Adding More Than Two Decimals

**Calculate: 2.3 + 1.45 + 0.8**

```
  2.30
  1.45
+ 0.80
------
  4.55
```

**Answer: 4.55** ✓

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't** line up the right-hand side:
```
  3.4     WRONG!
+ 2.35
------
```

✓ **Do** line up the decimal points:
```
  3.40    CORRECT!
+ 2.35
------
  5.75
```

# Screen 4: Subtracting Decimals

Subtracting decimals works exactly like addition - **line up those decimal points!**

## Example 1: Simple Subtraction

**Calculate: 7.8 - 3.2**

```
  7.8
- 3.2
-----
  4.6
```

**Answer: 4.6** ✓

## Example 2: Different Decimal Places

**Calculate: 9.5 - 2.34**

**Step 1:** Line up decimal points (add zeros if needed)
```
  9.50
- 2.34
------
```

**Step 2:** Subtract each column from right to left
```
  9.50
- 2.34
------
  7.16
```

**Answer: 7.16** ✓

## Example 3: With Borrowing

**Calculate: 5.2 - 1.7**

This needs borrowing because we can't do 2 - 7.

```
  5.²2   (borrow 1 from 5, making it 4)
- 1.7    (12 - 7 = 5)
-----
  3.5
```

**Step-by-step:**
- Can't do 2 - 7, so borrow: 12 - 7 = 5
- 4 - 1 = 3

**Answer: 3.5** ✓

## Example 4: Subtracting from Whole Numbers

**Calculate: 10 - 3.45**

**Step 1:** Write 10 as 10.00 to line up decimal places
```
  10.00
-  3.45
-------
```

**Step 2:** Subtract with borrowing
```
  ⁹9.¹⁰⁰
  10.00
-  3.45
-------
   6.55
```

**Answer: 6.55** ✓

## Real-Life Example

**You have £10. You spend £7.35. How much change do you get?**

```
  10.00
-  7.35
-------
   2.65
```

**Answer: £2.65 change** ✓

# Screen 5: Multiplying Decimals by Whole Numbers

When multiplying decimals, there's a clever trick that makes it much easier!

## The Method

**Step 1:** Ignore the decimal point and multiply as normal
**Step 2:** Count how many digits are after the decimal point in the question
**Step 3:** Put the decimal point in the answer so it has the same number of digits after it

## Example 1: Simple Multiplication

**Calculate: 3.2 × 4**

**Step 1:** Ignore decimal: 32 × 4 = 128

**Step 2:** Count decimal places in question: 3.2 has **1** digit after the decimal point

**Step 3:** Put decimal point in answer with **1** digit after it: **12.8**

**Answer: 12.8** ✓

**Check:** 3 × 4 = 12, so 3.2 × 4 should be just over 12 ✓

## Example 2: More Decimal Places

**Calculate: 2.45 × 3**

**Step 1:** 245 × 3 = 735

**Step 2:** 2.45 has **2** digits after decimal point

**Step 3:** Answer must have **2** digits after decimal point: **7.35**

**Answer: 7.35** ✓

## Example 3: Larger Numbers

**Calculate: 1.8 × 7**

**Step 1:** 18 × 7 = 126

**Step 2:** 1.8 has **1** digit after decimal

**Step 3:** Answer has **1** digit after decimal: **12.6**

**Answer: 12.6** ✓

## Example 4: Multiplying by 10, 100, 1000

This is super easy - just move the decimal point to the **right**!

**Multiply by 10:** Move decimal point **1** place right
- 4.5 × 10 = **45**
- 0.3 × 10 = **3**
- 12.67 × 10 = **126.7**

**Multiply by 100:** Move decimal point **2** places right
- 4.5 × 100 = **450**
- 0.3 × 100 = **30**
- 1.234 × 100 = **123.4**

**Multiply by 1000:** Move decimal point **3** places right
- 4.5 × 1000 = **4500**
- 0.3 × 1000 = **300**

## Real-Life Example

**Apples cost £1.25 each. How much do 6 apples cost?**

```
1.25 × 6
= 125 × 6 (ignore decimal)
= 750
= 7.50 (2 decimal places)
```

**Answer: £7.50** ✓

# Screen 6: Multiplying Decimals by 10, 100, 1000

Understanding this pattern is **crucial** - you'll use it all the time!

## The Pattern

When multiplying by 10, 100, or 1000:
- The digits **don't change**
- The decimal point **moves to the right**
- Each zero moves it one more place

## Multiplying by 10

**Move decimal point 1 place to the RIGHT**

```
3.4 × 10 = 34
  ↑         ↑
  │         decimal moved right once
  original
```

**More examples:**
- 0.7 × 10 = **7**
- 5.23 × 10 = **52.3**
- 0.06 × 10 = **0.6**
- 145.8 × 10 = **1458**

## Multiplying by 100

**Move decimal point 2 places to the RIGHT**

```
3.4 × 100 = 340
  ↑          ↑
  │          decimal moved right twice
  original
```

**More examples:**
- 0.7 × 100 = **70**
- 5.23 × 100 = **523**
- 0.06 × 100 = **6**
- 1.5 × 100 = **150**

## Multiplying by 1000

**Move decimal point 3 places to the RIGHT**

```
3.4 × 1000 = 3400
  ↑           ↑
  │           decimal moved right three times
  original
```

**More examples:**
- 0.7 × 1000 = **700**
- 5.23 × 1000 = **5230**
- 0.06 × 1000 = **60**

## Adding Zeros When Needed

Sometimes you need to add zeros as placeholders:

**2.5 × 100 = ?**
- Move decimal 2 places right
- 2.5 → 25.0 → 250
- **Answer: 250** ✓

**0.4 × 1000 = ?**
- Move decimal 3 places right
- 0.4 → 4.00 → 400
- **Answer: 400** ✓

## Quick Check

Does your answer make sense?
- Multiplying by 10 makes numbers **10 times bigger**
- Multiplying by 100 makes numbers **100 times bigger**
- Multiplying by 1000 makes numbers **1000 times bigger**

If 2.5 × 10 = 25, then:
- 2.5 × 100 should be **ten times bigger** than 25 = **250** ✓
- 2.5 × 1000 should be **ten times bigger** than 250 = **2500** ✓

## Memory Trick

**"Times 10, move it right once for fun!"**
**"Times 100, two moves will do!"**
**"Times 1000, three moves, no less!"**
