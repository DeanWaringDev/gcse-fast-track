# Screen 1: Welcome to Algebra!

**Algebra** is one of the most powerful tools in mathematics - and it's easier than you think!

## What is Algebra?

Algebra is just **maths with letters**. Instead of always using numbers, we use letters to represent values we don't know yet or that can change.

**You already use algebra in real life:**
- 📱 "I need x amount of money to buy that phone"
- ⏰ "The bus arrives in y minutes"
- 🎮 "I scored n points in that game"
- 🍕 "Each person gets p slices of pizza"

## Why Use Letters?

**Example: Without Algebra**
```
I have some sweets.
I eat 5 sweets.
How many do I have left?

Answer: Depends on how many you started with!
```

**Example: With Algebra**
```
I have x sweets.
I eat 5 sweets.
I have (x - 5) sweets left.

This works for ANY starting number!
```

## The Power of Algebra

Algebra lets us:
- ✅ Write general rules that work for any number
- ✅ Solve problems where we don't know all the values
- ✅ Create formulas for real-world situations
- ✅ Understand patterns and relationships
- ✅ Build equations to find unknown values

**Example:**
```
Area of rectangle = length × width
In algebra: A = l × w

This formula works for EVERY rectangle!
```

## Don't Worry!

Algebra might look scary at first, but it's just **normal maths** where we sometimes use letters instead of numbers. Once you understand the basics, it becomes really natural!

# Screen 2: Variables - The Building Blocks

A **variable** is a letter that represents a number. It's called a variable because its value can vary (change).

## Common Variables

**We usually use these letters:**
- **x** and **y** - Most common in algebra
- **a**, **b**, **c** - For constants or unknowns
- **n** - Often used for counting (1st, 2nd, nth)
- **t** - For time
- **d** - For distance
- **Any letter works!** - Even z, p, q, m, etc.

## What Variables Represent

**Example 1: Unknown Values**
```
x = the number I'm thinking of
If I say "I'm thinking of x"
and x = 7
then I'm thinking of 7
```

**Example 2: Changing Values**
```
n = your age
When you're 14: n = 14
Next year: n = 15
The letter stays the same, the value changes!
```

**Example 3: General Rules**
```
Perimeter of square = 4 × side length
Using algebra: P = 4s

This works whether s = 5cm, s = 10cm, or any size!
```

## Important Points About Variables

**1. A variable represents ONE number at a time**
```
If x = 5, then x = 5 everywhere in that problem
You can't have x = 5 AND x = 7 in the same problem!
```

**2. Different letters can have different values**
```
x = 3 and y = 7 is fine
They're different variables
```

**3. The same letter means the same value**
```
In x + x + x
All three x's are the same number
If x = 4, then x + x + x = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12
```

# Screen 3: Writing Algebra - The Rules

In algebra, we write things differently than in normal maths. Here are the key rules:

## Rule 1: Multiplication Signs Are Hidden

In normal maths, we write: **3 × x**  
In algebra, we write: **3x**

**Examples:**
- 5 × a = **5a**
- 2 × y = **2y**
- x × y = **xy**
- 4 × x × y = **4xy**

**Why?** It's quicker and looks cleaner!

**Important:** We always write the number first!
- ✓ **3x** is correct
- ✗ **x3** looks like "x cubed" - wrong!

## Rule 2: One of Something

If there's just one of a variable, we don't write the 1:

**Examples:**
- 1 × x = **x** (not 1x)
- 1 × a = **a** (not 1a)
- 1 × y = **y** (not 1y)

**But:** x × 1 = **x** (multiplication by 1)

## Rule 3: Division Writes as Fractions

In algebra, we prefer fractions to division signs:

**Instead of:** x ÷ 3  
**We write:** x/3 or x over 3

**Examples:**
- a ÷ 2 = **a/2**
- 10 ÷ x = **10/x**
- (x + 3) ÷ 4 = **(x + 3)/4**

## Rule 4: Powers (Indices)

When we multiply a variable by itself:

**Examples:**
- x × x = **x²** (x squared)
- y × y × y = **y³** (y cubed)
- a × a × a × a = **a⁴** (a to the power 4)

## Quick Examples

**Write in algebra:**
- 5 times n = **5n**
- a multiplied by 3 = **3a**
- x divided by 4 = **x/4**
- 2 times x times y = **2xy**
- m times m = **m²**

# Screen 4: Expressions - Putting It Together

An **expression** is a collection of numbers, variables, and operations. Think of it like a phrase in maths.

## What is an Expression?

An expression is **NOT an equation** - it doesn't have an equals sign!

**These are expressions:**
- 3x + 5
- 2a - 7
- 4x² + 3x - 2
- x/2 + y

**These are equations (NOT expressions):**
- 3x + 5 = 11 (has equals sign)
- y - 3 = 10 (has equals sign)

## Parts of an Expression

**Example: 3x + 5**

```
3x + 5
│  │ │
│  │ └─ Number term (constant)
│  └─── Plus sign (operation)
└────── Variable term
```

**Each part separated by + or - is called a TERM**

## Terms Explained

A **term** is a part of an expression:

**Example: 4x - 2y + 7**
```
This expression has 3 terms:
Term 1: 4x
Term 2: -2y  (the minus sign stays with it!)
Term 3: +7   (also written as just 7)
```

**Types of Terms:**

**Variable Terms** - contain letters:
- 3x, -5y, 7a, xy

**Number Terms (Constants)** - just numbers:
- 5, -3, 10, 100

## Coefficients

The **coefficient** is the number in front of a variable:

**Examples:**
- In **5x**, the coefficient is 5
- In **3a**, the coefficient is 3
- In **x**, the coefficient is 1 (invisible!)
- In **-2y**, the coefficient is -2

**Remember:** If there's no number visible, the coefficient is 1!

# Screen 5: Evaluating Expressions - Substitution

**Substitution** means replacing variables with numbers to find the value of an expression.

## How to Substitute

**Step 1:** Replace each variable with its value  
**Step 2:** Calculate the result using BIDMAS

## Example 1: Simple Substitution

**Find the value of 3x + 5 when x = 4**

**Step 1: Substitute**
```
3x + 5
= 3 × 4 + 5  (replace x with 4)
```

**Step 2: Calculate**
```
= 12 + 5  (multiply first - BIDMAS!)
= 17
```

**Answer: 17** ✓

## Example 2: Negative Numbers

**Find 2a - 7 when a = 3**

```
2a - 7
= 2 × 3 - 7
= 6 - 7
= -1
```

**Answer: -1** ✓

## Example 3: Two Variables

**Find 2x + 3y when x = 5 and y = 2**

```
2x + 3y
= 2 × 5 + 3 × 2
= 10 + 6
= 16
```

**Answer: 16** ✓

## Example 4: With Powers

**Find x² + 4 when x = 3**

```
x² + 4
= 3² + 4
= 9 + 4
= 13
```

**Answer: 13** ✓

## Example 5: More Complex

**Find 4a - 2b + 5 when a = 6 and b = 3**

```
4a - 2b + 5
= 4 × 6 - 2 × 3 + 5
= 24 - 6 + 5
= 23
```

**Answer: 23** ✓

## Top Tips for Substitution

1. **Replace ALL instances** of each variable
2. **Use brackets** if you're substituting negative numbers
3. **Follow BIDMAS** - multiply before adding/subtracting
4. **Show your working** - makes it easier to spot mistakes

# Screen 6: Real-World Algebra

Let's see how algebra appears in everyday situations!

## Formulas You Know

**Perimeter of Rectangle**
```
P = 2l + 2w

Where:
P = perimeter
l = length
w = width

If l = 5 and w = 3:
P = 2(5) + 2(3) = 10 + 6 = 16
```

**Speed, Distance, Time**
```
Speed = Distance ÷ Time
s = d/t

If d = 100 miles and t = 2 hours:
s = 100/2 = 50 mph
```

**Area of Triangle**
```
A = ½bh

Where:
b = base
h = height

If b = 6 and h = 4:
A = ½ × 6 × 4 = 12
```

## Money Problems

**Cinema Tickets**
```
Cost = number of adults × £12 + number of children × £8

In algebra: C = 12a + 8c

If a = 2 adults and c = 3 children:
C = 12(2) + 8(3) = 24 + 24 = £48
```

## Phone Plans

**Monthly Cost**
```
Bill = fixed charge + (cost per minute × minutes)

In algebra: B = 10 + 0.5m

If m = 40 minutes:
B = 10 + 0.5(40) = 10 + 20 = £30
```

## Age Problems

**Comparing Ages**
```
Sally is 3 years older than Tom

If Tom is x years old:
Sally is x + 3

If x = 12:
Sally is 12 + 3 = 15 years old
```
