# Screen 1: Percentage Increase - The Basics

**Percentage increase** means making something **bigger** by a percentage amount.

You see this all the time:
- **Prices:** "Prices increased by 10%"
- **Wages:** "Salary increased by 5%"
- **Population:** "Population grew by 15%"
- **Sales:** "Sales up 20%"

## Two Methods to Increase

### Method 1: Add On Method (Two Steps)

**Example:** Increase £50 by 20%

**Step 1:** Find 20% of £50
- 20% of £50 = 0.2 × 50 = £10

**Step 2:** Add to original
- £50 + £10 = **£60** ✓

### Method 2: Multiplier Method (One Step) ⚡

This is the **FAST** way - learn this!

**Think:** If increasing by 20%, you have:
- Original 100%
- Plus 20% increase
- Total = 120%

**Step 1:** Convert to decimal
- 120% = 1.2

**Step 2:** Multiply
- £50 × 1.2 = **£60** ✓

**Same answer, but much faster!**

## Why Multipliers Are Brilliant

Instead of two calculations (find %, then add), you do **one multiplication**!

**Pattern for increases:**
- Increase by 10% → multiply by **1.1** (100% + 10% = 110%)
- Increase by 20% → multiply by **1.2** (100% + 20% = 120%)
- Increase by 25% → multiply by **1.25** (100% + 25% = 125%)
- Increase by 50% → multiply by **1.5** (100% + 50% = 150%)
- Increase by 75% → multiply by **1.75** (100% + 75% = 175%)

**Formula:**
```
New Amount = Original × (1 + percentage as decimal)
```

## Example: Wage Increase

**Your wage is £24,000. It increases by 5%. New wage?**

**Add On Method:**
- 5% of £24,000 = 0.05 × 24,000 = £1,200
- £24,000 + £1,200 = **£25,200** ✓

**Multiplier Method:**
- Increase by 5% = multiply by 1.05
- £24,000 × 1.05 = **£25,200** ✓

**The multiplier is MUCH quicker!**

# Screen 2: Percentage Decrease - The Basics

**Percentage decrease** means making something **smaller** by a percentage amount.

Common examples:
- **Sales:** "30% OFF!"
- **Depreciation:** "Car value decreased 15%"
- **Population:** "Numbers fell by 5%"
- **Discounts:** "Save 25%!"

## Two Methods to Decrease

### Method 1: Subtract Method (Two Steps)

**Example:** Decrease £80 by 20%

**Step 1:** Find 20% of £80
- 20% of £80 = 0.2 × 80 = £16

**Step 2:** Subtract from original
- £80 - £16 = **£64** ✓

### Method 2: Multiplier Method (One Step) ⚡

This is the **FAST** way!

**Think:** If decreasing by 20%, you have:
- Original 100%
- Minus 20% decrease
- Remaining = 80%

**Step 1:** Convert to decimal
- 80% = 0.8

**Step 2:** Multiply
- £80 × 0.8 = **£64** ✓

**Same answer, one step!**

## Why Multipliers Work for Decreases

When you decrease, you're finding what's **left over**!

**Pattern for decreases:**
- Decrease by 10% → multiply by **0.9** (100% - 10% = 90%)
- Decrease by 20% → multiply by **0.8** (100% - 20% = 80%)
- Decrease by 25% → multiply by **0.75** (100% - 25% = 75%)
- Decrease by 30% → multiply by **0.7** (100% - 30% = 70%)
- Decrease by 50% → multiply by **0.5** (100% - 50% = 50%)

**Formula:**
```
New Amount = Original × (1 - percentage as decimal)
```

## Example: Sale Price

**Jacket costs £90. Sale: 30% off. Sale price?**

**Subtract Method:**
- 30% of £90 = 0.3 × 90 = £27 discount
- £90 - £27 = **£63** ✓

**Multiplier Method:**
- Decrease by 30% = multiply by 0.7
- £90 × 0.7 = **£63** ✓

**Multiplier saves time every time!**

# Screen 3: Finding Multipliers - The Easy Way

Converting percentages to multipliers is **super easy** once you know the trick!

## For Percentage INCREASES

**Rule:** Add the percentage to 100%, then convert to decimal

**Example 1:** Increase by 15%
- 100% + 15% = 115%
- 115% = 115 ÷ 100 = **1.15** ✓

**Example 2:** Increase by 8%
- 100% + 8% = 108%
- 108% = 108 ÷ 100 = **1.08** ✓

**Example 3:** Increase by 35%
- 100% + 35% = 135%
- 135% = 135 ÷ 100 = **1.35** ✓

## For Percentage DECREASES

**Rule:** Subtract the percentage from 100%, then convert to decimal

**Example 1:** Decrease by 15%
- 100% - 15% = 85%
- 85% = 85 ÷ 100 = **0.85** ✓

**Example 2:** Decrease by 8%
- 100% - 8% = 92%
- 92% = 92 ÷ 100 = **0.92** ✓

**Example 3:** Decrease by 35%
- 100% - 35% = 65%
- 65% = 65 ÷ 100 = **0.65** ✓

## Quick Reference Table

| Change | Multiplier | Calculation |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| +10% | 1.1 | 110% = 1.1 |
| +20% | 1.2 | 120% = 1.2 |
| +25% | 1.25 | 125% = 1.25 |
| +50% | 1.5 | 150% = 1.5 |
| -10% | 0.9 | 90% = 0.9 |
| -20% | 0.8 | 80% = 0.8 |
| -25% | 0.75 | 75% = 0.75 |
| -50% | 0.5 | 50% = 0.5 |

## Memory Trick

**Increases:** Multiplier starts with **1.something** (more than 1)
**Decreases:** Multiplier starts with **0.something** (less than 1)

Makes sense! Increasing makes bigger (>1), decreasing makes smaller (<1)!

# Screen 4: Using Multipliers - Worked Examples

Let's practice using multipliers for real-world problems!

## Example 1: Price Increase

**Petrol was £1.40/litre. Price increased 12%. New price?**

**Step 1:** Find multiplier
- Increase 12% → 100% + 12% = 112% = **1.12**

**Step 2:** Multiply
- £1.40 × 1.12 = **£1.57 per litre** ✓

## Example 2: Sale Discount

**Trainers cost £75. Sale: 35% off. Sale price?**

**Step 1:** Find multiplier
- Decrease 35% → 100% - 35% = 65% = **0.65**

**Step 2:** Multiply
- £75 × 0.65 = **£48.75** ✓

## Example 3: Population Growth

**Town population: 45,000. Grew 8%. New population?**

**Step 1:** Find multiplier
- Increase 8% → 100% + 8% = 108% = **1.08**

**Step 2:** Multiply
- 45,000 × 1.08 = **48,600 people** ✓

## Example 4: Depreciation

**Car worth £18,000. Depreciated 15%. New value?**

**Step 1:** Find multiplier
- Decrease 15% → 100% - 15% = 85% = **0.85**

**Step 2:** Multiply
- £18,000 × 0.85 = **£15,300** ✓

## Example 5: Restaurant Bill

**Meal costs £45. Add 12% service charge. Total bill?**

**Step 1:** Find multiplier
- Increase 12% → 100% + 12% = 112% = **1.12**

**Step 2:** Multiply
- £45 × 1.12 = **£50.40** ✓

## Example 6: Staff Reduction

**Company: 240 staff. Reduced by 25%. New staff number?**

**Step 1:** Find multiplier
- Decrease 25% → 100% - 25% = 75% = **0.75**

**Step 2:** Multiply
- 240 × 0.75 = **180 staff** ✓

**See the pattern? Two steps every time:**
1. Find the multiplier
2. Multiply the original amount

# Screen 5: Multiple Changes - Repeated Increases/Decreases

What happens when you increase or decrease **more than once**?

## Example 1: Two Increases

**Bank account: £500. Earns 10% interest 2 years running.**

**After Year 1:**
- £500 × 1.1 = £550

**After Year 2:**
- £550 × 1.1 = £605 ✓

**OR in one calculation:**
- £500 × 1.1 × 1.1 = £500 × 1.1² = **£605** ✓

## Example 2: Two Decreases

**Car worth £20,000. Depreciates 20% per year for 2 years.**

**After Year 1:**
- £20,000 × 0.8 = £16,000

**After Year 2:**
- £16,000 × 0.8 = £12,800 ✓

**OR in one calculation:**
- £20,000 × 0.8 × 0.8 = £20,000 × 0.8² = **£12,800** ✓

## Important: It's Not Just Adding!

**Common Mistake:** ❌

"Two 10% increases = 20% increase" - **WRONG!**

**Reality:** ✓

Two 10% increases:
- 100 × 1.1 × 1.1 = 121

That's a **21% total increase**, not 20%!

Why? Because the second 10% is on the **new, larger amount**!

## Example 3: Increase Then Decrease

**Item: £100. Up 20%, then down 20%. Final price?**

**Step 1:** Increase 20%
- £100 × 1.2 = £120

**Step 2:** Decrease 20% (of £120, not £100!)
- £120 × 0.8 = **£96** ✓

**Not back to £100!** You lost money overall!

**Why?** The decrease is 20% of a **bigger number**!

## Example 4: Decrease Then Increase

**Price: £80. Down 25%, then up 25%. Final price?**

**Step 1:** Decrease 25%
- £80 × 0.75 = £60

**Step 2:** Increase 25% (of £60, not £80!)
- £60 × 1.25 = **£75** ✓

**Still not back to the original!**

## Key Learning

When dealing with multiple changes:
- Apply each multiplier **in order**
- The base amount **changes** after each step
- Changes don't simply add up!

# Screen 6: Real-World Applications

Let's apply percentage changes to real situations you'll encounter!

## Shopping Sales

**Scenario:** Coat originally £120. Black Friday: 40% off. Boxing Day: Extra 10% off sale price.

**Black Friday:**
- £120 × 0.6 = £72

**Boxing Day (10% off £72):**
- £72 × 0.9 = **£64.80 final price** ✓

**Total saved:** £120 - £64.80 = **£55.20**

## House Prices

**Scenario:** House £200,000. Increased 15% in Year 1, decreased 10% in Year 2. Current value?

**After Year 1:**
- £200,000 × 1.15 = £230,000

**After Year 2:**
- £230,000 × 0.9 = **£207,000** ✓

**Overall:** Up £7,000 (3.5% increase over 2 years)

## Salary and Tax

**Scenario:** Salary £30,000. Gets 8% raise. Then pays 20% tax on new salary.

**After raise:**
- £30,000 × 1.08 = £32,400

**Tax (20% of £32,400):**
- £32,400 × 0.2 = £6,480 tax

**Take-home:**
- £32,400 - £6,480 = **£25,920** ✓

**Alternative - Tax on take-home:**
- If 20% tax, you keep 80%
- £32,400 × 0.8 = **£25,920** ✓

## Investment Growth

**Scenario:** Invest £5,000. Grows 6% per year for 3 years.

**After 3 years:**
- £5,000 × 1.06 × 1.06 × 1.06
- £5,000 × 1.06³
- £5,000 × 1.191016
- **£5,955.08** ✓

**Interest earned:** £5,955.08 - £5,000 = **£955.08**

## Restaurant Bills

**Scenario:** Meal £68. Add 10% service. Then split between 4 people.

**With service:**
- £68 × 1.1 = £74.80

**Per person:**
- £74.80 ÷ 4 = **£18.70 each** ✓

## VAT Calculations

**Scenario:** Item £250 excluding VAT. Add 20% VAT.

**With VAT:**
- £250 × 1.2 = **£300** ✓

**Scenario:** Item £300 including VAT (20%). What was price before VAT?

**Before VAT:**
- £300 ÷ 1.2 = **£250** ✓

(We'll learn this "reverse percentage" properly later!)
