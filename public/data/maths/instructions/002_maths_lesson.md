# Screen 1: What Are Negative Numbers?

Imagine you're playing a game where you can score points or lose points. When you lose points, you go **below zero** - that's where negative numbers live!

Negative numbers are numbers **less than zero**. They're written with a minus sign in front, like **-5** or **-12**.

## The Number Line

Think of numbers as a line that goes in both directions from zero:

```
... -5  -4  -3  -2  -1  0  1  2  3  4  5 ...
        ←               →
    Negative        Positive
```

**Zero is special** - it's neither positive nor negative. It's right in the middle!

## Real-World Examples

You see negative numbers every day:

- **Temperature:** It's -3°C outside (3 degrees below freezing)
- **Money:** You're £20 overdrawn (you owe the bank money)
- **Elevation:** The Dead Sea is -430 meters (below sea level)
- **Time:** The year 500 BC was 500 years before year zero

## Key Point 🔑

The further left you go on the number line, the smaller the number gets. So **-10 is smaller than -2** (even though 10 is bigger than 2 in positive numbers!).

# Screen 2: Adding Negative Numbers

Adding negative numbers can feel tricky at first, but there's a simple way to think about it!

## The Golden Rule

**Adding a negative number is the SAME as subtracting a positive number.**

Think of it like this: If I give you -5, I'm really taking away 5!

## Examples

### Example 1
```
8 + (-3) = ?
```

This is the same as: **8 - 3 = 5**

On the number line, start at 8 and move 3 spaces LEFT:
```
... 4  5  6  7  8  9  10 ...
         ←←←
       5
```

**Answer: 5** ✓

### Example 2
```
-2 + (-4) = ?
```

This is the same as: **-2 - 4 = -6**

Start at -2 and move 4 spaces LEFT:
```
... -7  -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1 ...
        ←←←←←
       -6
```

**Answer: -6** ✓

### Example 3
```
-5 + (-3) = ?
```

This is the same as: **-5 - 3 = -8**

**Answer: -8** ✓

## Quick Tip! 💡

When you see **+ (-)** think: "the plus turns into a minus"

So **7 + (-4)** becomes **7 - 4 = 3**

---

# Screen 3: Subtracting Negative Numbers

This is where it gets interesting! Subtracting a negative number is like a **double negative** - two negatives make a positive!

## The Golden Rule

**Subtracting a negative number is the SAME as adding a positive number.**

Think of it like this: If I take away your debt, you actually have MORE money!

## Examples

### Example 1
```
10 - (-3) = ?
```

This is the same as: **10 + 3 = 13**

The two negative signs "cancel out" and become positive!

**Answer: 13** ✓

### Example 2
```
-5 - (-2) = ?
```

This is the same as: **-5 + 2 = -3**

Start at -5 and move 2 spaces RIGHT:
```
... -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1 ...
           →→
          -3
```

**Answer: -3** ✓

### Example 3
```
-8 - (-8) = ?
```

This is the same as: **-8 + 8 = 0**

They cancel each other out perfectly!

**Answer: 0** ✓

## Remember! 📖

When you see **- (-)** think: "the two minuses make a plus"

So **6 - (-2)** becomes **6 + 2 = 8**

# Screen 4: The Four Rules Combined

Let's put everything together! Here are all the rules in one place:

## Rule 1: Adding a Positive
```
5 + 3 = 8
-5 + 3 = -2
```
Move RIGHT on the number line ➡️

## Rule 2: Adding a Negative
```
5 + (-3) = 5 - 3 = 2
-5 + (-3) = -5 - 3 = -8
```
Move LEFT on the number line ⬅️

## Rule 3: Subtracting a Positive
```
5 - 3 = 2
-5 - 3 = -8
```
Move LEFT on the number line ⬅️

## Rule 4: Subtracting a Negative
```
5 - (-3) = 5 + 3 = 8
-5 - (-3) = -5 + 3 = -2
```
Move RIGHT on the number line ➡️

## The Pattern

Notice the pattern:
- **+ (+)** and **- (-)** both move you RIGHT ➡️
- **+ (-)** and **- (+)** both move you LEFT ⬅️

## Practice Together

Let's solve: **-3 + 7 - (-2)**

**Step 1:** -3 + 7 = 4
**Step 2:** 4 - (-2) = 4 + 2 = 6

**Answer: 6** ✓

# Screen 5: Multiplying and Dividing Negative Numbers

Now for the really useful rule that makes multiplication and division with negatives super easy!

## The Sign Rules

### Rule 1: Same Signs = Positive Answer
```
positive × positive = positive
negative × negative = positive

5 × 3 = 15
-5 × -3 = 15
```

**Think:** Two friends agree = positive outcome! ✓

### Rule 2: Different Signs = Negative Answer
```
positive × negative = negative
negative × positive = negative

5 × -3 = -15
-5 × 3 = -15
```

**Think:** Two friends disagree = negative outcome! ✗

## Examples - Multiplication

### Example 1
```
-4 × -6 = ?
```
Same signs (both negative) → positive answer
**Answer: 24** ✓

### Example 2
```
-7 × 3 = ?
```
Different signs → negative answer
**Answer: -21** ✓

### Example 3
```
8 × -2 = ?
```
Different signs → negative answer
**Answer: -16** ✓

## Examples - Division

The same rules work for division!

### Example 4
```
-20 ÷ -4 = ?
```
Same signs → positive answer
**Answer: 5** ✓

### Example 5
```
-18 ÷ 3 = ?
```
Different signs → negative answer
**Answer: -6** ✓

## Easy Memory Trick! 🧠

**Same signs: Happy face ☺️ = Positive**
**Different signs: Sad face ☹️ = Negative**

# Screen 6: Common Mistakes to Avoid

Let's look at the traps that catch most students out!

## Mistake 1: Adding Instead of Changing Signs

❌ **WRONG:**
```
5 - (-3)
= 5 - 3     (forgot to change the sign)
= 2         (WRONG!)
```

✓ **CORRECT:**
```
5 - (-3)
= 5 + 3     (two negatives make positive)
= 8         (RIGHT!)
```

**Lesson:** When you subtract a negative, change it to addition!

## Mistake 2: Getting Multiplication Signs Wrong

❌ **WRONG:**
```
-4 × -3
= -12       (kept negative)
```

✓ **CORRECT:**
```
-4 × -3
= 12        (same signs = positive)
```

**Lesson:** Same signs always give a positive answer!

## Mistake 3: Thinking -5 is Bigger Than -2

❌ **WRONG:**
```
Which is bigger: -5 or -2?
Answer: -5  (WRONG!)
```

✓ **CORRECT:**
```
Which is bigger: -5 or -2?
Answer: -2  (RIGHT!)
```

**Lesson:** On the number line, -2 is to the RIGHT of -5, so it's bigger!

## Mistake 4: Forgetting Brackets Matter

❌ **WRONG:**
```
-3 + -2
= -1        (added wrongly)
```

✓ **CORRECT:**
```
-3 + (-2)
= -3 - 2
= -5        (RIGHT!)
```

**Lesson:** When adding a negative, turn it into subtraction!

## Your Negative Numbers Checklist ✓

1. ☐ Is it **- (-)**? Change to **+**
2. ☐ Is it **+ (-)**? Change to **-**
3. ☐ Multiplying/dividing? Check if signs are **same** or **different**
4. ☐ Same signs = positive, different signs = negative

# Screen 7: You're Ready to Practice!

Excellent work! You now understand negative numbers - one of the most important maths skills! 🎉

## Quick Recap

**Addition & Subtraction:**
- **+ (-)** becomes **-** (adding negative = subtract)
- **- (-)** becomes **+** (subtracting negative = add)

**Multiplication & Division:**
- **Same signs** = **Positive answer** ✓
- **Different signs** = **Negative answer** ✗

**Number Line:**
- Numbers get **smaller** as you go left ⬅️
- Numbers get **bigger** as you go right ➡️

## Remember These Key Points:

✓ Use the number line to visualize - it really helps!

✓ Two negatives make a positive (when multiplying, dividing, or subtracting)

✓ Different signs always make negative (when multiplying or dividing)

✓ -10 is smaller than -1 (think about temperature!)

✓ Practice makes perfect - the more you do it, the more natural it feels!
