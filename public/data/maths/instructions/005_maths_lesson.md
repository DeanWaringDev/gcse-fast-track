# Screen 1: What Are Percentages?

**Percentage** means "out of 100". The symbol is **%**.

You see percentages everywhere:
- **Sales:** "50% OFF!"
- **Grades:** "You scored 85%"
- **Statistics:** "60% of people prefer..."
- **Discounts:** "Save 20%"
- **Battery:** "Phone at 75%"

## Understanding "Per Cent"

The word **"percent"** comes from Latin:
- **Per** = "for each"
- **Cent** = "hundred"

So **50%** means **50 out of every 100** or **50 per hundred**.

## Visualizing Percentages

Imagine a grid with 100 squares:

```
[██████████] = 100 squares = 100%
[█████     ] = 50 squares  = 50%
[██        ] = 25 squares  = 25%
[█         ] = 10 squares  = 10%
```

**Key Understanding:**
- 100% = the whole thing = everything
- 50% = half
- 25% = a quarter
- 10% = one tenth
- 1% = one hundredth

## Why Percentages Are Useful

Percentages let us compare things easily:
- **School A:** 45 out of 60 passed
- **School B:** 70 out of 100 passed

Which is better? Hard to tell! But as percentages:
- **School A:** 75% passed
- **School B:** 70% passed

Now it's obvious - School A did better! ✓

# Screen 2: Converting Between Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages

Percentages, decimals, and fractions are all **different ways of showing the same thing**!

## The Triangle of Conversion

```
        FRACTION
         ↗  ↘
        ↙    ↘
   DECIMAL ⟷ PERCENTAGE
```

They're all connected and you can convert between them!

## Fraction to Percentage

**Method:** 
1. Make the denominator 100 (if possible)
2. The numerator is your percentage

**Example 1:** Convert 1/2 to a percentage
```
1/2 = ?/100

To get from 2 to 100, multiply by 50
So: 1/2 = 50/100 = 50%
```

**Example 2:** Convert 3/4 to a percentage
```
3/4 = ?/100

To get from 4 to 100, multiply by 25
So: 3/4 = 75/100 = 75%
```

**Example 3:** Convert 1/5 to a percentage
```
1/5 = ?/100

To get from 5 to 100, multiply by 20
So: 1/5 = 20/100 = 20%
```

## Decimal to Percentage

**Method:** Multiply by 100 (move decimal point 2 places right)

**Examples:**
- 0.5 × 100 = **50%**
- 0.25 × 100 = **25%**
- 0.75 × 100 = **75%**
- 0.1 × 100 = **10%**
- 0.83 × 100 = **83%**

## Percentage to Decimal

**Method:** Divide by 100 (move decimal point 2 places left)

**Examples:**
- 50% ÷ 100 = **0.5**
- 25% ÷ 100 = **0.25**
- 75% ÷ 100 = **0.75**
- 10% ÷ 100 = **0.1**
- 83% ÷ 100 = **0.83**

## Percentage to Fraction

**Method:** Write as fraction over 100, then simplify

**Examples:**
- 50% = 50/100 = **1/2**
- 25% = 25/100 = **1/4**
- 75% = 75/100 = **3/4**
- 20% = 20/100 = **1/5**
- 60% = 60/100 = **3/5**

## Quick Reference Table

| Fraction | Decimal | Percentage |
|----------|---------|------------|
| 1/2      | 0.5     | 50%        |
| 1/4      | 0.25    | 25%        |
| 3/4      | 0.75    | 75%        |
| 1/5      | 0.2     | 20%        |
| 1/10     | 0.1     | 10%        |
| 1/100    | 0.01    | 1%         |

**Memorize these common conversions - they'll save you time!**

# Screen 3: Finding 10% and 1%

Finding **10%** and **1%** are the building blocks for finding ANY percentage!

## Finding 10%

**Method:** Divide by 10 (move decimal point 1 place left)

**Why?** 10% means 10 out of 100, which is the same as 1 out of 10 = dividing by 10!

**Examples:**
- 10% of 50 = 50 ÷ 10 = **5**
- 10% of 80 = 80 ÷ 10 = **8**
- 10% of 120 = 120 ÷ 10 = **12**
- 10% of 35 = 35 ÷ 10 = **3.5**
- 10% of 450 = 450 ÷ 10 = **45**

**Quick Trick:** Just move the decimal point one place left!
- 10% of 600 → 60.0 → **60**
- 10% of 2500 → 250.0 → **250**

## Finding 1%

**Method:** Divide by 100 (move decimal point 2 places left)

**Why?** 1% means 1 out of 100 = dividing by 100!

**Examples:**
- 1% of 200 = 200 ÷ 100 = **2**
- 1% of 500 = 500 ÷ 100 = **5**
- 1% of 1200 = 1200 ÷ 100 = **12**
- 1% of 350 = 350 ÷ 100 = **3.5**
- 1% of 4500 = 4500 ÷ 100 = **45**

**Quick Trick:** Move the decimal point two places left!
- 1% of 800 → 8.00 → **8**
- 1% of 3000 → 30.00 → **30**

## Why This Is Powerful

Once you can find 10% and 1%, you can find **any** percentage!

**Example:** Find 23% of 400
- 10% of 400 = 40
- 10% of 400 = 40 (again)
- 1% of 400 = 4
- 1% of 400 = 4 (again)
- 1% of 400 = 4 (again)

So: 23% = 10% + 10% + 1% + 1% + 1%
23% of 400 = 40 + 40 + 4 + 4 + 4 = **92** ✓

# Screen 4: Finding Any Percentage - The Building Block Method

Now you can find 10% and 1%, you can find **any percentage** by building it up!

## The Building Block Strategy

**Steps:**
1. Find 10% (divide by 10)
2. Find 1% (divide by 100) if needed
3. Build up to the percentage you want

## Example 1: Find 30% of 200

**Step 1:** Find 10%
- 10% of 200 = 200 ÷ 10 = 20

**Step 2:** Multiply by 3 (for 30%)
- 30% = 10% × 3
- 30% of 200 = 20 × 3 = **60** ✓

## Example 2: Find 5% of 80

**Method A - Use 10%:**
- 10% of 80 = 8
- 5% is half of 10%
- 5% of 80 = 8 ÷ 2 = **4** ✓

**Method B - Use 1%:**
- 1% of 80 = 0.8
- 5% = 1% × 5
- 5% of 80 = 0.8 × 5 = **4** ✓

## Example 3: Find 25% of 60

**Clever Method - It's a quarter!**
- 25% = 1/4
- 25% of 60 = 60 ÷ 4 = **15** ✓

**Building Block Method:**
- 10% of 60 = 6
- 10% of 60 = 6 (again)
- 5% of 60 = 3 (half of 10%)
- 25% = 10% + 10% + 5%
- 25% of 60 = 6 + 6 + 3 = **15** ✓

## Example 4: Find 17% of 300

**Step 1:** Find 10%
- 10% of 300 = 30

**Step 2:** Find 1%
- 1% of 300 = 3

**Step 3:** Build 17%
- 17% = 10% + (7 × 1%)
- 17% of 300 = 30 + (7 × 3)
- 17% of 300 = 30 + 21 = **51** ✓

## Common Percentages - Quick Methods

**50% = Half**
- 50% of 80 = 80 ÷ 2 = 40

**25% = Quarter**
- 25% of 80 = 80 ÷ 4 = 20

**75% = Three quarters**
- 75% of 80 = (80 ÷ 4) × 3 = 60

**20% = One fifth**
- 20% of 80 = 80 ÷ 5 = 16

# Screen 5: Finding Percentages Using the Calculator Method

There's an even faster way using decimals and multiplication!

## The Formula Method

**To find a percentage of an amount:**
```
Percentage × Amount = Answer
(as decimal)
```

**Steps:**
1. Convert percentage to decimal (÷ 100)
2. Multiply by the amount

## Example 1: Find 30% of 200

**Step 1:** Convert 30% to decimal
- 30% = 30 ÷ 100 = 0.3

**Step 2:** Multiply
- 0.3 × 200 = **60** ✓

## Example 2: Find 15% of 80

**Step 1:** Convert 15% to decimal
- 15% = 15 ÷ 100 = 0.15

**Step 2:** Multiply
- 0.15 × 80 = **12** ✓

## Example 3: Find 8% of 250

**Step 1:** Convert 8% to decimal
- 8% = 8 ÷ 100 = 0.08

**Step 2:** Multiply
- 0.08 × 250 = **20** ✓

## Example 4: Find 65% of 140

**Step 1:** Convert 65% to decimal
- 65% = 65 ÷ 100 = 0.65

**Step 2:** Multiply
- 0.65 × 140 = **91** ✓

## Which Method Should You Use?

**Use Building Blocks when:**
- Simple percentages (10%, 20%, 5%)
- No calculator available
- Small numbers

**Use Formula Method when:**
- Complicated percentages (17%, 23%, 67%)
- Calculator available
- Larger numbers
- Exams (often faster!)

## Both Methods Work!

**Find 12% of 50**

**Building Blocks:**
- 10% of 50 = 5
- 1% of 50 = 0.5
- 12% = 10% + (2 × 1%)
- 12% of 50 = 5 + 1 = **6** ✓

**Formula:**
- 12% = 0.12
- 0.12 × 50 = **6** ✓

Same answer! Use whichever feels easier!

# Screen 6: Real-Life Percentage Problems

Percentages are used constantly in real life - let's practice with real scenarios!

## Shopping and Sales

**Example 1:** Sale - 20% off a £60 jacket

**Method 1 - Find discount first:**
- 20% of £60 = 0.2 × 60 = £12 discount
- Price = £60 - £12 = **£48** ✓

**Method 2 - Find what you pay directly:**
- If 20% off, you pay 80%
- 80% of £60 = 0.8 × 60 = **£48** ✓

## Restaurant Bills and Tips

**Example 2:** Add 15% tip to a £40 meal

**Step 1:** Find 15%
- 15% of £40 = 0.15 × 40 = £6

**Step 2:** Add to bill
- Total = £40 + £6 = **£46** ✓

**Quick Method:**
- Paying 115% total (100% + 15%)
- 115% of £40 = 1.15 × 40 = **£46** ✓

## Test Scores

**Example 3:** You got 34 out of 40 on a test. What percentage?

**Method:**
```
Percentage = (Score ÷ Total) × 100
Percentage = (34 ÷ 40) × 100
Percentage = 0.85 × 100
Percentage = 85%
```

**You scored 85%!** ✓

## VAT and Tax

**Example 4:** Item costs £200 + 20% VAT

**Step 1:** Find VAT
- 20% of £200 = 0.2 × 200 = £40

**Step 2:** Add to price
- Total = £200 + £40 = **£240** ✓

**Quick Method:**
- Paying 120% total
- 120% of £200 = 1.2 × 200 = **£240** ✓

## Interest and Savings

**Example 5:** Save £500 with 3% annual interest

**Interest earned:**
- 3% of £500 = 0.03 × 500 = **£15** ✓

**Total after 1 year:**
- £500 + £15 = **£515** ✓
