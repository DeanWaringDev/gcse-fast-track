# Screen 1: Sharing Using Ratios

Now you know how to simplify ratios, let's learn how to **share amounts** using them!

This is one of the most useful ratio skills - you'll use it constantly in real life:
- 💰 **Splitting money fairly** between people
- 🍰 **Dividing ingredients** for recipes
- 🎨 **Mixing paint colors** in correct proportions
- 👥 **Allocating resources** in projects
- 🏆 **Sharing prize money** in teams

## What Does "Share in a Ratio" Mean?

When you **share in a ratio**, you divide an amount into parts that match the ratio.

**Example:**
```
Share £20 in the ratio 1:3

This means:
• One person gets 1 part
• The other person gets 3 parts
• Total parts = 1 + 3 = 4 parts
• £20 ÷ 4 = £5 per part

Person 1: 1 × £5 = £5
Person 2: 3 × £5 = £15

Check: £5 + £15 = £20 ✓
```

## The Key Principle

**The ratio tells you how many parts each person gets, NOT the actual amounts!**

```
Ratio 2:3 means:
• First person gets 2 parts
• Second person gets 3 parts
• NOT £2 and £3!
```

## Why This Matters

**Fair sharing based on different needs or contributions:**

- Two people work different hours: share pay 2:5
- Recipe for different number of people: scale up 1:2
- Investment returns based on contribution: split 3:7
- Paint mixing for exact color: combine 4:1

The ratio shows the **proportion**, not the actual values!

# Screen 2: The 3-Step Method

Here's the reliable method that works for ANY ratio sharing problem:

## The 3-Step Method

**Step 1:** Add up the parts in the ratio  
**Step 2:** Divide the total amount by the number of parts  
**Step 3:** Multiply each part by the value from Step 2

## Example 1: Share £30 in ratio 2:3

**Step 1: Add the parts**
```
2 + 3 = 5 parts total
```

**Step 2: Find value of one part**
```
£30 ÷ 5 = £6 per part
```

**Step 3: Work out each share**
```
First person: 2 × £6 = £12
Second person: 3 × £6 = £18
```

**Check:** £12 + £18 = £30 ✓

**Answer: £12 and £18** ✓

## Example 2: Share 60 sweets in ratio 1:2

**Step 1:** 1 + 2 = 3 parts

**Step 2:** 60 ÷ 3 = 20 sweets per part

**Step 3:**
- First person: 1 × 20 = 20 sweets
- Second person: 2 × 20 = 40 sweets

**Check:** 20 + 40 = 60 ✓

**Answer: 20 and 40 sweets** ✓

## Example 3: Share £100 in ratio 3:7

**Step 1:** 3 + 7 = 10 parts

**Step 2:** £100 ÷ 10 = £10 per part

**Step 3:**
- First: 3 × £10 = £30
- Second: 7 × £10 = £70

**Check:** £30 + £70 = £100 ✓

**Answer: £30 and £70** ✓

# Screen 3: Three-Way Sharing

Sharing between THREE people works exactly the same way - just add a third part!

## The Same 3-Step Method

**Step 1:** Add ALL the parts  
**Step 2:** Divide total by number of parts  
**Step 3:** Multiply each part by the value

## Example 1: Share £60 in ratio 1:2:3

**Step 1: Add the parts**
```
1 + 2 + 3 = 6 parts total
```

**Step 2: Value per part**
```
£60 ÷ 6 = £10 per part
```

**Step 3: Each share**
```
Person 1: 1 × £10 = £10
Person 2: 2 × £10 = £20
Person 3: 3 × £10 = £30
```

**Check:** £10 + £20 + £30 = £60 ✓

**Answer: £10, £20, and £30** ✓

## Example 2: Share 120 marbles in ratio 2:3:5

**Step 1:** 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 parts

**Step 2:** 120 ÷ 10 = 12 marbles per part

**Step 3:**
- Person 1: 2 × 12 = 24 marbles
- Person 2: 3 × 12 = 36 marbles
- Person 3: 5 × 12 = 60 marbles

**Check:** 24 + 36 + 60 = 120 ✓

**Answer: 24, 36, and 60 marbles** ✓

## Example 3: Share £150 in ratio 1:1:3

**Step 1:** 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 parts

**Step 2:** £150 ÷ 5 = £30 per part

**Step 3:**
- Person 1: 1 × £30 = £30
- Person 2: 1 × £30 = £30
- Person 3: 3 × £30 = £90

**Check:** £30 + £30 + £90 = £150 ✓

**Answer: £30, £30, and £90** ✓

**Notice:** Two people can get the same amount if their ratio parts are equal!

# Screen 4: Working Backwards - Finding the Total

Sometimes you know ONE person's share and need to find the total amount!

## The Reverse Method

**If you know one share, you can find:**
1. The value of one part
2. How many parts total
3. The total amount

## Example 1: Finding the Total

**Question:** Money is shared in ratio 2:3. If the larger share is £15, what was the total?

**Step 1: Work out value per part**
```
Larger share = 3 parts = £15
So 1 part = £15 ÷ 3 = £5
```

**Step 2: Work out other share**
```
Smaller share = 2 parts = 2 × £5 = £10
```

**Step 3: Find total**
```
Total = £10 + £15 = £25
```

**Answer: £25 total** ✓

## Example 2: Another Reverse Problem

**Question:** Tom and Sam share money 3:5. Tom gets £12. How much does Sam get?

**Step 1: Value per part**
```
Tom has 3 parts = £12
1 part = £12 ÷ 3 = £4
```

**Step 2: Sam's share**
```
Sam has 5 parts = 5 × £4 = £20
```

**Answer: Sam gets £20** ✓

## Example 3: Three-Way Reverse

**Question:** Amy, Ben, and Cara share in ratio 2:3:5. Cara gets £20. What's the total?

**Step 1: Value per part**
```
Cara has 5 parts = £20
1 part = £20 ÷ 5 = £4
```

**Step 2: Other shares**
```
Amy: 2 × £4 = £8
Ben: 3 × £4 = £12
```

**Step 3: Total**
```
£8 + £12 + £20 = £40
```

**Answer: £40 total** ✓

# Screen 5: Real-World Applications

Let's apply ratio sharing to situations you'll actually face!

## Business & Work

**Example 1: Profit Sharing**
```
Two partners invest in ratio 3:2.
The business makes £5,000 profit.
How should they split it?

Step 1: 3 + 2 = 5 parts
Step 2: £5,000 ÷ 5 = £1,000 per part
Step 3: Partner A: 3 × £1,000 = £3,000
       Partner B: 2 × £1,000 = £2,000

Answer: £3,000 and £2,000
```

## Cooking & Recipes

**Example 2: Scaling a Recipe**
```
Recipe uses flour:sugar in ratio 3:1.
You have 200g of mixture.
How much flour and sugar?

Step 1: 3 + 1 = 4 parts
Step 2: 200g ÷ 4 = 50g per part
Step 3: Flour: 3 × 50g = 150g
       Sugar: 1 × 50g = 50g

Answer: 150g flour, 50g sugar
```

## Group Projects

**Example 3: Team Prize Money**
```
Team of 3 wins £300.
They worked in ratio 2:3:5.
Fair share for each?

Step 1: 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 parts
Step 2: £300 ÷ 10 = £30 per part
Step 3: Member A: 2 × £30 = £60
       Member B: 3 × £30 = £90
       Member C: 5 × £30 = £150

Answer: £60, £90, and £150
```

## Inheritance & Money

**Example 4: Splitting Inheritance**
```
£120,000 split between 3 siblings: 1:2:5
How much does each get?

Step 1: 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 parts
Step 2: £120,000 ÷ 8 = £15,000 per part
Step 3: Child 1: 1 × £15,000 = £15,000
       Child 2: 2 × £15,000 = £30,000
       Child 3: 5 × £15,000 = £75,000

Answer: £15k, £30k, and £75k
```

# Screen 6: Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them

Let's look at the errors students often make - and how to get it right!

## Mistake 1: Using Ratio Numbers as Actual Amounts

**WRONG ❌**
```
Share £50 in ratio 2:3

Person 1 gets £2
Person 2 gets £3
Total: £2 + £3 = £5  WRONG!
```

**RIGHT ✓**
```
Share £50 in ratio 2:3

Step 1: 2 + 3 = 5 parts
Step 2: £50 ÷ 5 = £10 per part
Step 3: Person 1: 2 × £10 = £20
       Person 2: 3 × £10 = £30

Check: £20 + £30 = £50 ✓
```

**Remember:** The ratio shows PARTS, not amounts!

## Mistake 2: Forgetting to Add All Parts

**WRONG ❌**
```
Share £90 in ratio 2:3:5

£90 ÷ 2 = £45  (WRONG!)
```

**RIGHT ✓**
```
Step 1: 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 parts (ALL parts!)
Step 2: £90 ÷ 10 = £9 per part
Step 3: 2 × £9 = £18
       3 × £9 = £27
       5 × £9 = £45
```

**Remember:** Add ALL parts first!

## Mistake 3: Not Checking Your Answer

**ALWAYS check your shares add up to the total!**

```
Share £80 in ratio 3:5

Step 1: 3 + 5 = 8 parts
Step 2: £80 ÷ 8 = £10
Step 3: £30 and £50

Check: £30 + £50 = £80 ✓ CORRECT!

If they don't add up, you made a mistake!
```

## Mistake 4: Getting Confused with Reverse Problems

**WRONG ❌**
```
Ratio 2:3, larger share is £18
Total = £18 + £18 = £36  WRONG!
```

**RIGHT ✓**
```
Larger share is 3 parts = £18
1 part = £18 ÷ 3 = £6
Smaller share = 2 × £6 = £12
Total = £12 + £18 = £30 ✓
```
