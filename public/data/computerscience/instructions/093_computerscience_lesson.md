# Screen 1: Introduction to Advanced - Object-Oriented Programming

Welcome to Advanced - Object-Oriented Programming!

This programming project brings together multiple skills you've learned. Advanced - Object-Oriented Programming will challenge you to apply your knowledge creatively!

## What You'll Learn

In this lesson, you'll master:
- **Oop** - Essential CS concept
- **Classes** - Essential CS concept
- **Objects** - Essential CS concept

## Why This Matters

Programming projects test your ability to combine multiple skills. They're similar to the programming task in Paper 2 of your GCSE exam.

# Screen 2: Key Concepts

## Understanding Oop

Oop is a key concept in Programming.

### Core Principles:

**What is it?**
A fundamental concept in Programming that you need to understand for your GCSE.

**Why is it important?**
- Essential for understanding programming
- Frequently appears in GCSE exams
- Practical real-world applications
- Builds on previous knowledge

**Key Terminology:**

- **Oop** - Important component to understand
- **Classes** - Important component to understand
- **Objects** - Important component to understand
- **Inheritance** - Important component to understand

### Important Points to Remember:

✓ Master the fundamentals first  
✓ Understand why, not just what  
✓ Practice with varied examples  
✓ Connect to other topics you've learned

# Screen 3: Working Through Examples

## Example 1: Planning Your Approach

**Step 1:** Break down the problem  
**Step 2:** Plan your algorithm  
**Step 3:** Write pseudocode first  
**Step 4:** Implement in Python  
**Step 5:** Test thoroughly

## Example 2: Solving Common Challenges

Let's look at typical issues you might face and how to overcome them:

- **Problem:** Logic errors in your code
- **Solution:** Use print statements to track variable values
- **Prevention:** Plan carefully before coding

**Remember:** Good programmers test constantly!
