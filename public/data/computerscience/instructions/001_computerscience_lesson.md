# Screen 1: Welcome to Computer Science!

Have you ever wondered how your phone knows what you're typing before you finish? Or how Netflix recommends exactly what you want to watch? That's **Computer Science** in action!

Computer Science isn't just about computers - it's about **solving problems** using logical thinking and creating instructions that computers can follow.

## What Will You Learn?

In GCSE Computer Science, you'll discover:

- **How computers work** - What's inside them and how they process information
- **Programming** - Writing code to make computers do what you want
- **Problem-solving** - Breaking big challenges into small, solvable steps
- **Digital citizenship** - Using technology safely and responsibly

## Why Does This Matter?

Computer Science skills are everywhere in modern life:
- Every app on your phone
- Online shopping and banking
- Video games and streaming services
- Self-driving cars and robots
- Medical equipment and space exploration

By learning Computer Science, you're not just learning about computers - you're learning skills that will help you in **any career** you choose!

# Screen 2: What is Computational Thinking?

**Computational thinking** is the superpower of Computer Scientists! It's a way of solving problems that computers can help us with.

## The Four Pillars

Computer Scientists break down problems using four key skills:

### 1. Decomposition 🧩
**Breaking big problems into smaller, manageable pieces**

Example: Making a sandwich
- Get bread
- Get fillings
- Spread butter
- Add fillings
- Put slices together

### 2. Pattern Recognition 🔍
**Spotting similarities and patterns to solve problems faster**

Example: If you can make one sandwich, you can make a hundred - it's the same pattern repeated!

### 3. Abstraction 🎯
**Focusing on important details and ignoring unnecessary information**

Example: To make a sandwich, you don't need to know where the wheat was grown - just that you need bread!

### 4. Algorithm Design 📝
**Creating step-by-step instructions to solve a problem**

Example: A recipe is an algorithm for cooking - follow the steps in order and you get the result!

## Real-World Example

**Problem:** Getting to school on time

**Decomposition:** Wake up, get dressed, eat breakfast, travel to school
**Pattern Recognition:** It's the same routine every day
**Abstraction:** You don't need to think about every sock you put on - just "get dressed"
**Algorithm:** If alarm rings, then wake up. If hungry, then eat breakfast. If late, then hurry!

# Screen 3: Computers Are Everywhere!

You might think computers are just laptops and phones, but they're hidden in **so many things** around you!

## Embedded Systems

An **embedded system** is a computer built into another device to control it. You've probably used dozens today without realizing!

### In Your Home 🏠
- **Washing machine** - Controls water temperature, spin speed, cycle time
- **Microwave** - Manages cooking time and power levels
- **Smart TV** - Streams content, connects to internet, remembers your preferences
- **Central heating** - Maintains temperature, switches on/off automatically
- **Digital alarm clock** - Keeps time, plays music, connects to phone

### In Transport 🚗
- **Cars** - Engine management, anti-lock brakes, parking sensors, sat nav
- **Buses** - Route displays, payment systems, next stop announcements
- **Trains** - Automatic doors, climate control, ticket barriers

### In Public 🏪
- **Cash machines (ATMs)** - Dispense money, check balance, transfer funds
- **Self-checkout tills** - Scan items, calculate total, process payment
- **Traffic lights** - Control traffic flow, detect cars waiting
- **Vending machines** - Accept payment, dispense snacks, track stock

## Why Are They Everywhere?

Computers are perfect for jobs that need:
- **Accuracy** - No mistakes in calculations
- **Speed** - Process millions of operations per second
- **Repetition** - Never get tired or bored
- **Consistency** - Same result every time

# Screen 4: Input, Process, Output

Every computer system - from your phone to a supercomputer - works the same way: **Input → Process → Output**

## The Three Stages

### 1️⃣ INPUT
**Getting data INTO the computer**

Examples:
- Typing on a keyboard
- Clicking a mouse
- Touching a screen
- Speaking to a voice assistant
- Taking a photo with a camera
- Scanning a barcode

### 2️⃣ PROCESS
**The computer works on the data**

Examples:
- Calculating the total in a shopping basket
- Filtering a photo to make it black and white
- Finding the fastest route on a map
- Checking if a password is correct
- Sorting emails by date

### 3️⃣ OUTPUT
**Getting results OUT of the computer**

Examples:
- Displaying text on a screen
- Playing sound through speakers
- Printing a document
- Sending a message
- Lighting up an LED
- Moving a robot arm

## Example: Online Shopping

**INPUT:** You search for "trainers" and click on a pair you like
**PROCESS:** The website finds matching products, calculates price with delivery, checks stock
**OUTPUT:** Shows you the trainers, displays price, tells you delivery date

# Screen 5: Hardware vs Software

Computers need **both** hardware and software to work - like how you need both a body and a brain to think!

## Hardware 🔧

**Hardware** is anything you can physically touch.

**Examples:**
- **Keyboard** - For typing
- **Mouse** - For pointing and clicking
- **Screen** - For displaying information
- **Processor (CPU)** - The "brain" that does calculations
- **Memory (RAM)** - Temporary storage while working
- **Hard drive** - Permanent storage for files
- **Speakers** - For playing sound

**Think of hardware as:** The musical instrument

## Software 💾

**Software** is the programs and instructions that tell the hardware what to do.

**Examples:**
- **Operating systems** - Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS
- **Applications** - Word processors, games, web browsers
- **Apps** - Social media, messaging, photo editors
- **Utilities** - Antivirus, file backup, system cleaners

**Think of software as:** The sheet music

## They Need Each Other!

- Hardware without software is like a piano with no music - it can't do anything useful
- Software without hardware is like sheet music with no instrument - you can't play it
- Together, they create something powerful! 🎵

## Example: Playing Music

**Hardware:** Phone, speakers, screen, processor
**Software:** Spotify app, operating system, music files
**Result:** You can listen to your favourite songs!
