Join is a fundamental concept in Databases.

### Core Principles:

**What is it?**
Join allows you to solve problems efficiently in Computer Science.

**How does it work?**
- Step 1: Understand the syntax
- Step 2: Apply to simple examples
- Step 3: Build to complex problems
- Step 4: Practice until automatic

**Key Terminology:**

- **Join** - Essential component to master
- **Inner Join** - Essential component to master
- **Foreign Key** - Essential component to master

### Important Rules:

✓ Always follow proper syntax  
✓ Test your code/queries regularly  
✓ Comment your work for clarity

# Screen 3: Working Through Examples

Let's see this in action with clear, step-by-step examples.

## Example 1: Basic Query

```sql
-- Example SQL statement
-- Step-by-step breakdown:
-- 1. Identify what data you need
-- 2. Write the query
-- 3. Check the results
```

**Analysis:**
- What does this query do?
- Why is it structured this way?
- How could we modify it?

## Example 2: More Complex Query

Now let's combine multiple concepts for a more powerful query.
