# Screen 1: What is BIDMAS?

Have you ever wondered why calculators get different answers than you do? It's all about the **order** you do things!

BIDMAS is a rule that tells us **which order** to do calculations in. It stands for:

- **B**rackets
- **I**ndices (powers and roots - we'll learn these later!)
- **D**ivision
- **M**ultiplication
- **A**ddition
- **S**ubtraction

## Why Does This Matter?

Look at this simple calculation:

```
5 + 3 × 2
```

**If you work left to right:**
- First: 5 + 3 = 8
- Then: 8 × 2 = **16** ❌ Wrong!

**If you follow BIDMAS (multiply first):**
- First: 3 × 2 = 6
- Then: 5 + 6 = **11** ✓ Correct!

The same numbers, but different answers! That's why we need BIDMAS - so everyone gets the same answer.

# Screen 2: Multiplication & Division Come First

Here's the golden rule: **Always do multiplication and division BEFORE addition and subtraction.**

Think of it like this: multiplication and division are VIP guests - they always go first in the queue!

## Let's Practice This

### Example 1
```
10 + 6 × 2
```

**Step 1:** Look for multiplication or division → we have 6 × 2
**Step 2:** Do the multiplication first → 6 × 2 = 12
**Step 3:** Now do the addition → 10 + 12 = **22** ✓

### Example 2
```
20 - 12 ÷ 4
```

**Step 1:** Look for multiplication or division → we have 12 ÷ 4
**Step 2:** Do the division first → 12 ÷ 4 = 3
**Step 3:** Now do the subtraction → 20 - 3 = **17** ✓

### Example 3
```
8 + 5 × 3 - 4
```

**Step 1:** Do the multiplication → 5 × 3 = 15
**Step 2:** Now work left to right → 8 + 15 = 23
**Step 3:** Finish it off → 23 - 4 = **19** ✓

## Common Mistake to Avoid! ⚠️

Don't just work left to right! Always scan the calculation first and do any multiplication or division before moving on.

# Screen 3: Brackets Rule Everything

Remember: **B** is the first letter in BIDMAS, which means brackets are the MOST important!

**Brackets always come first - no exceptions!**

Think of brackets like opening a gift box. You have to open the box (do what's inside the brackets) before you can do anything with what's inside!

## How Brackets Change Everything

Look how brackets completely change the answer:

### Without Brackets
```
5 + 3 × 2 = ?
```
- Multiply first: 3 × 2 = 6
- Then add: 5 + 6 = **11**

### With Brackets
```
(5 + 3) × 2 = ?
```
- Brackets first: 5 + 3 = 8
- Then multiply: 8 × 2 = **16**

Same numbers, different brackets, totally different answer!

## More Examples

### Example 1
```
(8 - 4) × 3
```
**Step 1:** Do the brackets → 8 - 4 = 4
**Step 2:** Now multiply → 4 × 3 = **12** ✓

### Example 2
```
(12 + 6) ÷ 3
```
**Step 1:** Do the brackets → 12 + 6 = 18
**Step 2:** Now divide → 18 ÷ 3 = **6** ✓

### Example 3
```
20 - (15 - 7)
```
**Step 1:** Do the brackets → 15 - 7 = 8
**Step 2:** Now subtract → 20 - 8 = **12** ✓

## Key Point 🔑

Whatever is inside brackets gets treated as a mini-calculation that you must finish first!

# Screen 4: Left to Right with Same Priority

Here's something that trips people up: **Division and Multiplication have EQUAL priority.**

The same goes for Addition and Subtraction - they're also equal!

When operations have equal priority, work **left to right** - like reading a book.

## Division and Multiplication (Equal Priority)

### Example 1
```
12 ÷ 4 × 3
```

Don't multiply first just because you see it! They're equal priority, so go left to right:
- First: 12 ÷ 4 = 3
- Then: 3 × 3 = **9** ✓

### Example 2
```
8 × 2 ÷ 4
```
- First: 8 × 2 = 16
- Then: 16 ÷ 4 = **4** ✓

## Addition and Subtraction (Equal Priority)

### Example 3
```
15 - 7 + 4
```
Work left to right:
- First: 15 - 7 = 8
- Then: 8 + 4 = **12** ✓

### Example 4
```
20 + 8 - 12
```
- First: 20 + 8 = 28
- Then: 28 - 12 = **16** ✓

## Remember! 📖

When operations are at the same level (× and ÷, or + and -), treat them like reading - work from **left to right**.

# Screen 5: Putting It All Together

Now let's combine everything you've learned! This is where BIDMAS really shines.

Here's the process:
1. **B**rackets first
2. **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision next (left to right)
3. **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction last (left to right)

## Complex Example - Step by Step

Let's solve this together:
```
(8 + 4) × 3 - 16 ÷ 4
```

### Step 1: Brackets
```
(8 + 4) × 3 - 16 ÷ 4
= 12 × 3 - 16 ÷ 4
```

### Step 2: Multiplication and Division (left to right)
```
= 12 × 3 - 16 ÷ 4
= 36 - 16 ÷ 4      (did the multiplication)
= 36 - 4           (did the division)
```

### Step 3: Subtraction
```
= 36 - 4
= 32 ✓
```

## Another Example

```
5 + (3 × 2) + 12 ÷ 4
```

### Step 1: Brackets
```
= 5 + 6 + 12 ÷ 4
```

### Step 2: Division
```
= 5 + 6 + 3
```

### Step 3: Addition (left to right)
```
= 11 + 3
= 14 ✓
```

## Pro Tip! 💡

Take your time! Scan the whole calculation first, spot the brackets, then work through it methodically. Don't rush!

# Screen 6: Common Mistakes to Avoid

Let's look at the traps that catch most students out - so you can avoid them!

## Mistake 1: Working Purely Left to Right

❌ **WRONG:**
```
5 + 3 × 2
= 8 × 2        (added first)
= 16           (WRONG!)
```

✓ **CORRECT:**
```
5 + 3 × 2
= 5 + 6        (multiplied first)
= 11           (RIGHT!)
```

**Lesson:** Always do multiplication and division before addition and subtraction!

## Mistake 2: Forgetting About Brackets

❌ **WRONG:**
```
(5 + 3) × 2
= 5 + 6        (multiplied first, ignored brackets)
= 11           (WRONG!)
```

✓ **CORRECT:**
```
(5 + 3) × 2
= 8 × 2        (brackets first)
= 16           (RIGHT!)
```

**Lesson:** Brackets ALWAYS come first - no matter what!

## Mistake 3: Not Working Left to Right with Equal Priority

❌ **WRONG:**
```
12 ÷ 4 × 3
= 12 ÷ 12      (did × first)
= 1            (WRONG!)
```

✓ **CORRECT:**
```
12 ÷ 4 × 3
= 3 × 3        (left to right)
= 9            (RIGHT!)
```

**Lesson:** When operations have equal priority, work left to right like reading a book!

## Your BIDMAS Checklist ✓

Before you start any calculation, ask yourself:

1. ☐ Are there any **brackets**? (Do these first!)
2. ☐ Any **multiplication or division**? (Do these next, left to right)
3. ☐ Any **addition or subtraction**? (Do these last, left to right)
