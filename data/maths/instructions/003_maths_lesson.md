# Screen 1: Understanding Fractions

A fraction is a way of showing **part of a whole**. Think of sharing a pizza!

## What Do The Numbers Mean?

Every fraction has two numbers:

```
  3  ← Numerator (top number) - How many pieces you have
  —
  4  ← Denominator (bottom number) - How many pieces in total
```

So **3/4** means "3 pieces out of 4 pieces total" - you've got 3 slices of a pizza that was cut into 4 slices!

## Real-World Examples

You see fractions everywhere:

- **Cooking:** Add 1/2 cup of flour
- **Time:** It's quarter past three (1/4 of an hour = 15 minutes)
- **Money:** That costs £1.50 (1 pound and 50/100 or 1/2 pound)
- **Sport:** We're 3/4 of the way through the match

## Key Point 🔑

The **denominator** (bottom number) tells you what size the pieces are. The bigger the denominator, the SMALLER each piece!

Think about it:
- 1/2 of a pizza = BIG slice (cut into 2 pieces)
- 1/8 of a pizza = tiny slice (cut into 8 pieces)

## Proper vs Improper Fractions

**Proper fraction:** Top smaller than bottom (like 3/4)
**Improper fraction:** Top bigger than bottom (like 7/4) - you've got MORE than one whole!

# Screen 2: Equivalent Fractions

Here's something cool: different fractions can represent the SAME amount!

## The Magic Rule

You can **multiply** or **divide** BOTH the top and bottom by the same number, and the fraction stays the same value!

### Example 1: Making Bigger
```
1     1 × 2     2
— = ——————— = —
2     2 × 2     4
```

Half a pizza is the same as 2 quarters of a pizza!

### Example 2: Making Smaller (Simplifying)
```
6     6 ÷ 3     2
— = ——————— = —
9     9 ÷ 3     3
```

This is called **simplifying** - making the numbers smaller but keeping the same value.

## Why Does This Matter?

You need equivalent fractions to add or subtract fractions with different denominators!

## Finding Equivalent Fractions

Let's find three equivalent fractions for 1/3:

```
1     1 × 2     2
— = ——————— = —
3     3 × 2     6

1     1 × 3     3
— = ——————— = —
3     3 × 3     9

1     1 × 4     4
— = ——————— = ——
3     3 × 4     12
```

All of these mean EXACTLY the same amount!

## Quick Tip! 💡

To simplify a fraction, find the biggest number that divides into BOTH the top and bottom. This is called the **Highest Common Factor (HCF)**.

# Screen 3: Adding Fractions - Same Denominator

When fractions have the SAME denominator (bottom number), adding is super easy!

## The Golden Rule

**Keep the denominator the same, just add the numerators (top numbers)!**

Think of it like this: If you have 2 slices of pizza and I give you 3 more slices, you now have 5 slices - the pizza size hasn't changed!

## Examples

### Example 1
```
2     3     2 + 3     5
— + — = ———— = —
7     7       7       7
```

**Steps:**
1. Check denominators are the same ✓ (both 7)
2. Add the numerators: 2 + 3 = 5
3. Keep the denominator: 7
4. Answer: 5/7

### Example 2
```
1     2     1 + 2     3
— + — = ———— = —
5     5       5       5
```

### Example 3
```
3     4     3 + 4     7
— + — = ———— = —
8     8       8       8
```

## What If The Answer Is Improper?

Sometimes your answer might be an improper fraction:

```
5     4     9
— + — = —
7     7     7
```

This is fine! You can leave it as 9/7, or convert it to a mixed number: 1 2/7 (one whole and two sevenths).

## Remember! 📖

When denominators match, **only add the tops, keep the bottom the same!**

# Screen 4: Subtracting Fractions - Same Denominator

Subtracting fractions with the same denominator is just like adding - but you subtract instead!

## The Golden Rule

**Keep the denominator the same, just subtract the numerators!**

## Examples

### Example 1
```
5     2     5 - 2     3
— - — = ———— = —
8     8       8       8
```

**Steps:**
1. Check denominators are the same ✓ (both 8)
2. Subtract the numerators: 5 - 2 = 3
3. Keep the denominator: 8
4. Answer: 3/8

### Example 2
```
7     3     7 - 3     4
— - — = ———— = —
9     9       9       9
```

### Example 3
```
6     4     6 - 4     2     1
— - — = ———— = — = — (simplified)
10    10      10      10    5
```

Notice how we simplified 2/10 to 1/5 by dividing both top and bottom by 2!

## Real-World Example

You have 3/4 of a chocolate bar. You eat 1/4 of it. How much is left?

```
3     1     2     1
— - — = — or — (half!)
4     4     4     2
```

## Key Point 🔑

Always check if you can **simplify** your answer! Look for a number that divides into both the top and bottom.

# Screen 5: Finding Common Denominators

Now for the tricky bit - what if the denominators are DIFFERENT?

You can't add 1/3 + 1/4 directly - it's like trying to add apples and oranges!

## The Solution: Make The Denominators Match!

We need to find a **common denominator** - a number that both denominators divide into.

## Method 1: Find The Lowest Common Multiple (LCM)

The **LCM** is the smallest number that both denominators go into.

### Example: 1/3 + 1/4

**Step 1:** List multiples of each denominator:
- Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, **12**, 15, 18...
- Multiples of 4: 4, 8, **12**, 16, 20...

**Step 2:** Find the first number that appears in both lists: **12**

**Step 3:** Convert both fractions to twelfths:
```
1     1 × 4     4
— = ——————— = ——
3     3 × 4     12

1     1 × 3     3
— = ——————— = ——
4     4 × 3     12
```

**Step 4:** Now add them:
```
4      3      7
—— + —— = ——
12     12     12
```

## Method 2: Quick Trick - Multiply The Denominators

If you can't spot the LCM quickly, just multiply the two denominators together!

### Example: 1/3 + 1/5

```
Common denominator = 3 × 5 = 15

1     1 × 5     5
— = ——————— = ——
3     3 × 5     15

1     1 × 3     3
— = ——————— = ——
5     5 × 3     15

Answer: 5/15 + 3/15 = 8/15
```

## Pro Tip! 💡

Method 1 (LCM) gives you smaller numbers to work with, but Method 2 is faster if you're in a hurry! Both work perfectly.

# Screen 6: Adding and Subtracting - Different Denominators

Now let's put it all together! Here's the complete process:

## The Four Steps

1. **Find a common denominator**
2. **Convert both fractions**
3. **Add or subtract the numerators**
4. **Simplify if possible**

## Worked Example 1: Addition

Calculate: 2/5 + 1/3

**Step 1:** Find common denominator
- LCM of 5 and 3 = 15

**Step 2:** Convert both fractions
```
2     2 × 3     6
— = ——————— = ——
5     5 × 3     15

1     1 × 5     5
— = ——————— = ——
3     3 × 5     15
```

**Step 3:** Add the numerators
```
6      5      11
—— + —— = ——
15     15     15
```

**Step 4:** Can we simplify? No - 11 is prime!

**Answer: 11/15** ✓

## Worked Example 2: Subtraction

Calculate: 3/4 - 1/6

**Step 1:** Find common denominator
- LCM of 4 and 6 = 12

**Step 2:** Convert both fractions
```
3     3 × 3     9

6     6 × 2     12
```

**Step 3:** Subtract the numerators
```
9      2      7
—— - —— = ——
12     12     12
```

**Step 4:** Can we simplify? No!

**Answer: 7/12** ✓

## Worked Example 3: With Simplifying

Calculate: 1/2 + 1/4

**Step 1:** Common denominator = 4

**Step 2:** Convert
```
1     1 × 2     2
— = ——————— = —
2     2 × 2     4

1/4 stays as 1/4
```

**Step 3:** Add
```
2     1     3
— + — = —
4     4     4
```

**Answer: 3/4** ✓

# Screen 7: You're Ready to Practice!

Brilliant work! You now understand how to add and subtract fractions - a crucial maths skill! 🎉

## Quick Recap

**Same Denominators:**
- Add/subtract the **numerators** (top numbers)
- Keep the **denominator** (bottom number) the same
- Example: 3/7 + 2/7 = 5/7

**Different Denominators:**
1. Find a **common denominator** (LCM or multiply them together)
2. **Convert** both fractions
3. **Add/subtract** the numerators
4. **Simplify** if you can

## Remember These Key Points:

✓ Equivalent fractions = same value, different numbers (multiply/divide both top and bottom by same number)

✓ Same denominator? Just add/subtract the tops!

✓ Different denominators? Find a common one first!

✓ Always check if you can simplify at the end

✓ Practice makes perfect - fractions get easier the more you do them!
